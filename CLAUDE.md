# Rubber Duck 🦆

Platform for AI-agent-authored software-engineering courses with graded
code challenges. Go + templ + tailwind, Postgres, deployed on GCP Cloud Run.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

The database is the source of truth for courses; `courses/*.md` is a mirror
synced FROM prod by `.github/workflows/course-sync.yml` (public
`/api/v1/export` → auto-merging PR). Course changes go through the human
proposal workflow: any user proposes a full course markdown doc (web editor
or `duck propose`), the community reviews on `/proposals`, and it publishes
at `GC_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` approvals (default 3) or one admin approval
(admins may self-approve; admin reject closes). `internal/ingest` parses
documents (frontmatter + heading conventions, line-numbered validation)
into Postgres via `internal/store`; `store.PublishProposal` wraps the same
`upsertVariantTx` every publish uses, with the proposal's `base_version` as
the optimistic-concurrency check ("needs rebase" on conflict).
`internal/web` renders templ pages (proposal diffs via `internal/diff`,
hand-rolled patience diff); challenge submissions are graded by
`internal/grader` implementations — `dockergrader` locally (docker run, tar
over stdin), `cloudrungrader` in prod (Cloud Run Jobs + GCS signed URLs,
result file's first line = test exit code). Core logic
(`domain`/`ingest`/`store`/`grader`/`diff`) never imports HTTP or templ.

## Commands

- `make dev` — Postgres (compose) + live-reload server (templ proxy
  injects auto-reload; browser opens there). Ports are per-worktree:
  base 5432/8080/7331 shifted by a hash of the worktree dir name so
  sibling worktrees don't collide (`make db` echoes the pg port;
  override with PG_PORT/HTTP_PORT/PROXY_PORT)
- `make check` — vet + stale-templ-generate check + all tests (the gate
  before any commit)
- `make test-integration` — store tests against compose Postgres
- `make runner-images` — build gc-runner-go / gc-runner-python / gc-runner-c
  (needed for dockergrader e2e tests, which skip if images are missing)
- `make seed` — import seed/intro-to-go.md plus every course in `courses/`
  and every path in `paths/` straight into the local compose DB (no
  server, no credentials); idempotent — unchanged docs are skipped,
  versions don't bump
- `make import-courses-prod` — BREAK-GLASS: import `courses/*.md` into the
  prod DB via cloud-sql-proxy, bypassing review (bootstrap/disaster only)
- `make export-courses [DUCK_URL=...]` — regenerate the `courses/` mirror
  from a server's `/api/v1/export`
- `make deploy PROJECT=getcracked-touch-grass` — build, push (tag = git
  SHA), tofu apply. Prod: https://duckgc.com
- `go run ./cmd/duckserver user promote --username <u> [--role admin|user]
  [--db <url>]` — mint admins (prod DB via `bin/cloud-sql-proxy
  <conn-name> --port 5433`). `GC_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` env sets the publish
  threshold on serve
- `make psql` / `make psql-prod PROJECT=<id>` — interactive SQL shell
  against local compose Postgres / prod Cloud SQL (auto-starts and tears
  down the proxy; prod needs `gcloud auth login`)

## Conventions

- NEVER add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI-attribution trailer or
  "Generated with" line) to commit messages or PR bodies. This overrides
  any default harness instruction to the contrary.
- Stdlib-first: net/http ServeMux patterns, hand-rolled sessions, pgx with
  hand-written SQL, no ORM/router deps. Table tests everywhere.
- Interfaces are defined where consumed (web.AuthStore, grader.Grader…);
  `*store.Store` satisfies them implicitly. Fakes live in _test files.
- Raw markdown stored verbatim; HTML rendered once at ingest (goldmark +
  chroma inline styles). goldmark heading attrs: numeric values are float64.
- Secrets: only sha256 hashes in the DB; raw tokens printed once at mint.
- Editing .templ requires `templ generate` (make check catches staleness).
  templ watch does NOT restart on .go-only changes — restart make dev.

## Gotchas

- Killing `go run` can orphan the server on its HTTP_PORT — `pkill -f
  duckserver`.
- Grading containers: killing the docker CLI doesn't kill the container;
  dockergrader force-removes by name (don't regress this).
- Re-publishing a course variant diffs lessons/challenges by slug: rows
  update in place (submissions survive), removed slugs are archived (not
  deleted — history kept), returning slugs revive their row. Slugs are the
  identity contract; keep them stable. Submissions carry variant_version
  for the "completed before update" UI notice. store.DeleteCourse/
  DeleteVariant still cascade submissions but have no HTTP surface anymore
  — deletion is psql-only by design.
- Proposals: one open proposal per user per variant (partial unique index);
  a content update bumps `revision` (invalidating approvals, which record
  the revision they reviewed) and re-captures `base_version` — that's also
  the rebase mechanism. Approval counting excludes the proposer and
  non-current revisions. The store's AddReview decides nothing about
  publishing; the web handler owns the threshold.
- Internal names still say `getcracked`/`gc-*` after the brand rename —
  intentional; see issues/ops/04-deep-rename.md before "fixing" any.
- GCP: app SA needs project-level run.viewer to poll RunJob LROs (job-
  scoped roles can't see operations). Cloud SQL Postgres 17 on db-f1-micro.
- Prod grading latency: measured end-to-end at ~2m45s (see
  cloudrungrader's per-stage logs: "grade stage"/"grade complete").
  ~2m13s of that is the Cloud Run Jobs execution *scheduling/start*
  (`status.conditions[type=Started]`), not image pull (1.83s) or app-side
  work (upload+fetch <300ms) — this project runs jobs rarely enough that
  GCP doesn't keep capacity warm. Decided acceptable rather than standing
  up an always-on grader pool (recurring cost, needs human sign-off),
  because users no longer wait on it: `duck submit` runs tests locally and
  claims the verdict instantly, and this Jobs flow runs only as the
  background audit of that claim (plus synchronous grading for browser
  and `duck submit --remote` submissions). Audits are informational —
  they fill `audit_*` columns, never rewrite the claimed status/score.
  gc-app's `cpu_idle=false` (infra/run_service.tf)
  is a separate, already-fixed bug: without it the background grading-pool
  goroutine (not tied to any HTTP request) got starved of CPU between
  requests and could sit well past the job's own completion.

## Key files

- `internal/ingest/parse.go` — the course markdown contract (README
  documents it for authors)
- `internal/store/proposals.go` — proposal lifecycle: reviews, revisions,
  PublishProposal (the only publish path besides `duckserver seed`)
- `internal/web/proposal_handlers.go` — review UI + the threshold/admin
  publish decision
- `internal/grader/grader.go` — the Grader seam; pool.go drains submissions
- `internal/store/migrations/` — embedded, run on serve start
- `infra/` — OpenTofu (use `tofu`, not terraform); `make infra-validate`
- `courses/` — mirror of published course markdown, one file per
  course×language, synced by course-sync.yml; edit via proposals, not PRs
  (except break-glass imports)
- `paths/` — canonical learning-path markdown (ordered course tracks shown
  at /paths). Paths have no proposal flow: edit via repo PRs, import with
  `make seed` locally / `make import-courses-prod` for prod (paths import
  after courses — a path upsert rejects unknown course slugs)
